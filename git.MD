# Git and Github

### Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that allows developers to collaborate and work on projects without stepping over each otherâ€™s work and keeps a history of the work on each individuals repository. 

### GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 

##### The usage of these tools allows companies to increase their productivity whilst simultaneously becoming more competitive. This is through the advantage of Git which allows multiple developers to work on many features at one time and make progress without hindering one another. With the use of  Docker, a tool that allows developers to code a product without worrying about which device the product will eventually run on, these developers can work seamlessly. Also, with the aid of continuous integration and automated testing these changes and added features by the developers can be tested and automatically integrated into the software with minimal work from the developers. These make a company more efficient thus reducing any bottlenecks in the software development process.
